# Project 5: Proving your point using SQL

## Background

Over the campfire, you and a friend get into a debate about which college in Georgia has had the best MLB success. You need clear visualizations that depict the performance of Geogia college players compared to your favorite college's players. The [SeanLahman.com](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) has a comprehensive set of baseball data. We are going to use the 2019 SQL Lite version of the data. 

## Readings

- [R4DS: Chapter 13: Relational Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)
- [Py4DS: Chapter 13: Relational Data](https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/relational-data.html)
- [SQL Basics](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/basic/intro.html)

## Tasks

1. Complete the data joing and munging in R, Python, and SQL.
2. Complete the visualizations in R and Python.

- [ ] Establish 2-3 metrics/visualizations that can settle the debate and provide a sketch of what the charts may look like.
- [ ] Diagram the data you will need from the Lahman database.
